# Bitlatte Svelte
CLI tool that allows you to quickly setup new react projects.
Projects come pre configured with TypeScript Support, Vite,
Svelte Icons, and Svelte Routing.

## Usage
To use this tool I made it very simple. All you have to do is
run the following command replacing \<project_name\> with
whatever you wish to call your project:

```sh
npx bitgen -s <project_name>
```

The cli tool will setup your project and give you the next steps
to get up and running in no time.
